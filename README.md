## Downloading
If you just want to install this program, go to [Releases](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Iris-Screen-Exporter/releases/latest) and select the windows installer package of your choice from the **Assets** section.
## What is Iris
Iris captures sections of screen on one Windows computer and displays them on another.
Iris allows you to define “viewports” on your screen that will be captured and exported over the
network via UDP to be displayed on another machine. All of the settings are stored in the iris.xml
configuration file. Both the Iris server and Iris client can share the same configuration file. This makes it
possible to install Iris on a shared drive and run the executable files on different computers.
Iris also allows some image adjustments to be made on the captured screen before it is sent.  These
adjustments are limited to brightness, contrast and gamma.
